# JetsProject

## Description

This program 

## Technologies Used
	- Java
	- Eclipse
	- Sublime Text
	- Git/Github
	- MacOS Terminal
	- Interfaces
	- Inheritance
	- Method Overriding
	- Parsing strings into primitive types
	- ArrayLists
	- File input
	- Try/Catch

## Lessons Learned
	- This was a good refresher on Try/Catch and Interfaces for me.
	- This was also a very good refresher on ArrayLists, we didn't have generic types in Java 1.3 so that was new to me, even though we didn't put that to direct use in this assignment.


## How To Run
	- This program should function on its own, the Jets.txt file has a header that tells what field is what, that is ignored by the program, but other lines will be read in to establish the starting fleet.  It can be added to or altered as long as it meets the same format.
	- Type checking was not done for all inputs, but I did try to sanitize some inputs just for fun.
